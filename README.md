AccurateBlockPlacement: Reborn is a client-side mod for the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) and [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org) mod-loaders.

[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is required, [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) are optional, but strongly recommended.

## Features
**[WARNING]** This mod could get you banned on some servers with anti-cheats! Please check the servers rules before using this mod.

### Accurate Block Placement
Accurate Block Placement makes placing blocks a smooth and reliable process. The best way to explain it is the following GIF:

This can be toggled on or off by way of a configurable keybind. Accurate Block Placement is enabled by default, with no bound key.

### Fast Block Breaking
Fast Block Breaking makes breaking blocks much easier and more consistent, by removing the Mining Cooldown when breaking blocks.
